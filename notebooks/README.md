## Creating New Notebooks

When creating new notebooks, follow these guidelines:

1. Use a numbered prefix to indicate the order (e.g., `05_new_notebook.ipynb`)
2. Include markdown cells with explanations
3. Document all code cells
4. Keep notebooks focused on a single topic
5. Clean outputs before committing to version control
