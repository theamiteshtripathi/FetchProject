# Project Summary

## Overview

This project implements a multi-task learning system using sentence transformers. The system is designed to encode sentences into fixed-size vectors and perform multiple tasks simultaneously using a shared transformer backbone. The implementation demonstrates how to leverage pre-trained transformer models for multiple NLP tasks, showcasing the benefits of multi-task learning.

## Key Components

1. **Sentence Encoder**: A module that converts sentences into fixed-size embeddings using pre-trained transformer models.

2. **Multi-Task Model**: A model that combines the sentence encoder with task-specific heads for different NLP tasks.

3. **Task-Specific Heads**:
   - Classification Head: For sentence-level tasks like sentiment analysis.
   - Token Classification Head: For token-level tasks like named entity recognition.

4. **Training Pipeline**: A flexible training loop that supports different freezing strategies and multi-task learning scenarios.

5. **API Server**: A FastAPI server that provides endpoints for sentence encoding and multi-task predictions.

6. **Deployment Tools**: Docker and AWS deployment scripts for containerization and cloud deployment.

## Implemented Features

1. **Sentence Embedding**: The ability to convert sentences into fixed-size numerical vectors that capture their meaning.

2. **Multi-Task Learning**: The ability to train a single model on multiple tasks, leveraging shared knowledge.

3. **Transfer Learning**: The ability to fine-tune pre-trained transformer models for specific tasks.

4. **Freezing Strategies**: Support for different freezing scenarios to explore transfer learning approaches.

5. **Real Dataset Integration**: Support for training with real datasets (SST-2 and CoNLL-2003).

6. **API Endpoints**: RESTful API endpoints for sentence encoding and multi-task predictions.

7. **Containerization**: Docker support for easy deployment and reproducibility.

8. **Cloud Deployment**: AWS deployment scripts for scalable cloud hosting.
