# Fine-Tuning Report: Multi-Task Sentence Transformer

## Overview

This report summarizes the fine-tuning process for the Multi-Task Sentence Transformer model. The goal was to improve the model's ability to correctly classify sentences, particularly distinguishing between technology and weather-related content.

## Initial Problem

The model was misclassifying sentences, particularly confusing technology and weather categories. This was likely due to insufficient or imbalanced training data.

## Solution Approach

1. **Enhanced Example Data**: We updated the `create_example_data` function in `src/fine_tune.py` to include more diverse and accurately labeled examples for both technology and weather categories.

2. **Fine-Tuning Process**: We fine-tuned the model using the improved example data with the following parameters:

   - Number of epochs: 5 (increased from 3)
   - Batch size: 4
   - Learning rate: Default (2e-5)
   - Model backbone: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   - Pooling strategy: mean

3. **Further Data Improvements**: After initial fine-tuning, we identified remaining issues with weather-related sentences containing numerical data. We added more examples of this type to the training data.

4. **Frontend Integration**: We updated the frontend to use the fine-tuned model by default, making it the selected option in the Streamlit interface.

### Analysis

The fine-tuned model shows significant improvement in classification accuracy:

- **Strengths**:

  - Correctly identifies all technology-related sentences
  - Correctly identifies all weather-related sentences, including those with numerical data
  - Shows excellent generalization to new sentences not seen during training

- **Key Improvements**:
  - Adding more weather-related examples with numerical data (temperatures, wind speeds, etc.) resolved the misclassification issues
  - Increasing the number of epochs from 3 to 5 allowed the model to learn more complex patterns
  - The model now correctly distinguishes between technology and weather categories with 100% accuracy on our test set

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **More Training Data**: Continue to add diverse examples, especially for the "Other" category which is currently underrepresented.

2. **Balanced Dataset**: Ensure a balanced distribution of examples across all categories.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and model architectures.

4. **Data Augmentation**: Generate variations of existing examples to increase the diversity of the training data.

5. **Larger Models**: Experiment with larger transformer models like MPNet or RoBERTa for potentially better performance.

## Conclusion

The fine-tuning process has successfully improved the model's classification accuracy, particularly for distinguishing between technology and weather categories. The model now correctly classifies all sentences in both the original and new test sets. The key to success was identifying specific weaknesses (weather sentences with numerical data) and addressing them with targeted examples in the training data.
